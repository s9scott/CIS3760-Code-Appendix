# CIS3760-Code-Appendix
This Java code will be utilized on the CIS 3760 final exam

The useful files to understand are:
src->ShapeDrawApp.java (main application with a basic swing user interface)
src->shapeDraw->Circle.java
src->shapeDraw->Line.java
src->shapeDraw->Node.java
src->shapeDraw->NodeChangeListener.java
src->shapeDraw->Rectangle.java
src->shapeDraw->Shape.java
src->shapeDraw->Square.java
src->shapeDraw->Triangle.java

When run, this application displays a very simple window with three buttons along the top of the screen. The buttons are:
"Draw Square", "Draw Circle", and "Draw Random Shape". The application simply allows the user to draw a square, circle, or 
several "random" shapes to the screen by selecting one of these three buttons. Currently, the "random" shapes the application 
will draw are: square, circle, (equilateral) triangle, and rectangle. By default, a square is drawn to the screen.
